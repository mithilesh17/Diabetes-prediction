# Diabetes-prediction
In this project, we create a logistic regression model to predict diabetes 

Given to us is a dataset called diabetes.csv which contains attributes relating to age, pregnancy, glucose, blood pressure etc.,

Given this, data and a series of new entries stored in train.csv, our model produces a file predictions.csv containing <ID name> and predict whether the person is having diabetes or not.

This project is part of the Edyst Internship Program.
